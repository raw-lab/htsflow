# CSVs for Figures

- **averages_plots.csv:** The average VLP mL<sup>-1</sup>, standard deviation, and CV for each well plate experiment. Each location had three experiments ran. U corresponds to an untreated sample (i.e. no chloroform or benzonase). C corresponds to chloroform treatment only. C-B corresponds to chloroform and benzonase treatment, as detailed in the manuscript.
- **time_course.csv:** The VLP ml<sup>-1</sup> in each sample well. The Time Series column defines the amount of time that had elapsed since the beginning of the experiment, given as HH:MM:SS. 
- **FCM-EFM_averages.csv:** The average VLP ml<sup>-1</sup> and standard deviation for FGL and GSL when using EFM or FCM. EFM counts were obtained from [Bellanger et al., 2023](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01744-23)
- **untreated_rows.csv:** The VLP ml<sup>-1</sup> in each sample well for the untreated samples only. This file is organized by row to allow for comparisons of each row to row A.
- **WBS-Time-3wells.csv:** The VLP ml<sup>-1</sup> in each sample well for the untreated WBS well plate. This file is organized by a dynamic sliding window containing three sample wells to allow for comparisons of each window to the first window (A1 to A3).
